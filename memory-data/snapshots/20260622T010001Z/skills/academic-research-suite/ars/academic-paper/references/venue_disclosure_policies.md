# AI-Usage Disclosure Policy Database 鈥?v1

**Snapshot date**: 2026-04-09
**Scope**: v1 covers 6 ML/NLP-focused venues. Education/QA journals deferred to v2.
**Maintenance**: policies drift. Before submission, the user should verify against the venue's current page. The "source URL" and "access date" below record when ARS last verified each policy.

## How to use this file

This file is consumed by `disclosure_mode_protocol.md`. The mode looks up the venue by name, reads the structured fields below, and generates a tailored disclosure. Do NOT use this file as a standalone template 鈥?use disclosure mode.

If the venue is not listed here, the mode halts and asks the user to paste the current policy.

## Venue: Nature (Nature Publishing Group)

**Policy-source dedup pointer:** Nature's substantive AI policy text is co-cited by the #108 policy-anchor renderer (`policy_anchor_table.md` Nature section, verbatim quotes per 16 fields). Both consumers reference the canonical source pointer `shared/policy_data/nature_policy.md` so a future single-source-of-truth refactor can extract Nature's policy text without breaking either consumer's substantive content. Dedup invariant lint: `verify_nature_dedup_with_venue` in `scripts/check_policy_anchor_table.py`.

# REDACTED: sensitive-looking memory line

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Source URL | https://www.nature.com/nature/editorial-policies/ai |
| Access date | 2026-04-09 |
# REDACTED: sensitive-looking memory line
# REDACTED: sensitive-looking memory line
| Preferred disclosure location | **Methods section** (recommended by Nature) or Acknowledgements. Also mention in the cover letter. |
| Prohibited uses | AI-generated text or images cannot be presented as original human work without disclosure. Fabrication of references or data is prohibited under general integrity policy. |
# REDACTED: sensitive-looking memory line
| Notes | Lu et al. (2026, Nature 651:914-919) provides a worked example: their AI Scientist paper includes full disclosure in Methods and Ethics Statement, with explicit IRB-style approval for the human reviewer participation. |

| Required phrasing elements | Must name the tool. Must describe "the extent of use" 鈥?was it for drafting, editing, or brainstorming? ACL distinguishes between minor editing and substantive drafting. |
| Preferred disclosure location | A dedicated **"Use of AI Assistance"** subsection, placed after "Limitations" and before "References" |
| Prohibited uses | Submitting AI-generated text as the primary intellectual contribution without disclosure |
# REDACTED: sensitive-looking memory line
| Notes | ACL's "Use of AI Assistance" section is formatted separately from Acknowledgements. The tool should produce both sections if both apply. |

## Adding a new venue (v2 and beyond)

To add a venue to this database:

1. Find the venue's current AI-usage policy page (not a third-party summary).
2. Copy the structured fields above.
3. Fill in each field with verbatim or closely-paraphrased policy text.
4. Record the source URL and date accessed.
5. Add the venue entry to this file in alphabetical order.
6. Update the "Scope" line at the top.

For venues without a published AI policy: record "No explicit AI-usage policy found as of {date}" and flag this in disclosure mode output so the user knows they are using the generic template as fallback.

**Education/QA journals** targeted for v2: Higher Education, Quality in Higher Education, Studies in Higher Education, Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management. These will require separate research as their policies are less standardized than ML/NLP venues.
