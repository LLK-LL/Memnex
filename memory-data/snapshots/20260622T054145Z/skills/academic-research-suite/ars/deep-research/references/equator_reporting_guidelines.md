# EQUATOR Reporting Guidelines 鈥?Research Design and Reporting Guideline Mapping

## Purpose
Quick reference for EQUATOR Network (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) reporting guidelines.

- Difficulty implementing blinding (teachers/students know their group)
- Recommended to use **CONSORT-SPI** (Social and Psychological Interventions extension)

## Quick Reference: 3 Steps to Choosing a Reporting Guideline

1. **Identify your research design**: What type of research design is your study?
2. **Check the mapping table**: Find the corresponding reporting guideline
3. **Download the checklist**: Go to [EQUATOR Network](https://www.equator-network.org/) and download the full checklist

> Reminder: Reporting guidelines represent the minimum standard, not the quality ceiling. Meeting the checklist doesn't guarantee high research quality, but failing to meet the checklist typically indicates deficiencies in reporting quality.
